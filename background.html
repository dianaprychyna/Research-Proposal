    <h1>COVID-19 and Healthcare: The Implications of a Global Pandemic</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <h2>Background:</h2>
    <p>There is a massive ongoing discourse surrounding COVID-19 and healthcare already, even though it has only been two years. Healthcare workers are fighting for better working conditions, improved healthcare quality delivery to patients, and an increase in health promotion and education for the public. To start, one of the biggest issues COVID-19 has exposed is the shortages of PPE, primarily the quick shift from single-use PPE to reuse of PPE. Staff shortages and unsafe patient assignments have also been revealed by the pandemic. Some of the reasons for these staff shortages are: fear of developing the disease, dying from the disease, lack of PPE, mandated vaccines, or simply because of the treatment they received from patients and higher-management individuals. Although the articles and studies mentioned in the Literature Review to the right have discussed important aspects of these issues, I find that they lack information from a healthcare worker's perspective. There could be many other underlying reasons as to why these issues came to be, and just how much they’ve affected healthcare workers. I would like to explore these issues from a healthcare worker’s perspective. I want to know what healthcare workers, the people that are directly affected by these issues, have to say about them. However, I’m not quite sure how to structure this question. One way I could structure it is “How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected your ability to perform your job to deliver excellent health care to patients?" and "How much support are you receiving?”. </p>

    <h2>Literature Review:</h2>
    <p>In “Contributing factors to personal protective equipment shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic” published by the National Institutes of Health, the authors discuss the reasons behind a PPE shortage, and the consequences of this shortage. “Since early 2020 the US has experienced a severe shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) needed by healthcare workers fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. In protests covered by the news media, healthcare workers compared themselves to firefighters putting out fires without water and soldiers going into combat with cardboard body armor.” (Cohena, van der Meulen Rodgersc, 2020). Another article, “An international survey of healthcare workers use of personal protective equipment during the early stages of the COVID‐19 pandemic” by the National Institutes of Health, stated that “Healthcare workers reported an unprecedented need to reuse PPE that was designed for single‐use, specifically the N95 respirator. The reuse of PPE increased the perceived risk for COVID‐19 infection and harmed mental health.” (Key et al., 2021).</p>
    <p>In an article published by Stat News, Olivia Goldhill states, “The shortages are primarily caused by overwhelming numbers of patients as coronavirus spreads, combined with decreasing staff levels as nurses and doctors themselves fall sick or have to quarantine after being exposed to infected people.” (Goldhill, 2020).</p>
