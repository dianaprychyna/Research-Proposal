    <h1>COVID-19 and Healthcare: The Implications of a Global Pandemic</h1>
    
    <h2>My Research Design:</h2>
    <p>The methods I would like to use are interviews, surveys, and observation (maybe even a visual data method where I take photos or find photos/other information from social media). These methods would be best because it would keep healthcare workers anonymous, and they could feel comfortable about having an open conversation about what they’ve seen/experienced. It would also allow me to interview a large and wide variety of healthcare workers, and I could collect a lot of data. Healthcare workers would be my participants; I would include anyone that has worked directly with patients in any type of healthcare setting, because then I could get a diverse group of people and analyze the different results. I would interview healthcare workers who have worked at any time of the pandemic (even if they are not currently working). One way I would go about finding participants is interviewing people from places I used to work at/currently work at (the nursing home, the hospital, and the private clinic). The second way I could go about finding participants is by asking to interview students at PSU who work in healthcare and who work directly with patients. The last way I could go about finding participants is through my Instagram account, where I follow many pre-med and med student accounts; I could reach out to them and ask to interview them and/or use their posts in my research. The only types of participants I would exclude are healthcare workers who do not directly work with patients. I would do this because many of these workers who do not directly work with patients are not exposed to COVID-19 as much, and therefore have not seen/dealt with the most extreme cases and situations. For my study, I don’t believe there are any factors that I would need to control, other than what kind of healthcare workers will be participants (direct patient care positions), and listing where/what kind of facility they work at (ex. A hospital in California, United States). This is because I want to interfere as little as possible, and mainly just collect stories/experiences and observations. This would allow me to collect a wide range of information. For example, if I use the third method of finding participants (through social media), I could get more diverse information, especially if these individuals work in different states/countries. For each method I want to use (interviews, surveys, observation), I would have a different protocol. For interviews, I would have a set of questions prepared. I would also explore the option of a group interview, so that it wouldn’t be me asking questions and a participant responding, but a conversation of these issues that have arised in healthcare (however, I would first need to find partcipants that would be willing to do a group interview). For surveys, they would be similar to interviews. I would have a set of questions prepared, but different ways that participants could answer (ex. Multiple choice, ranks, or short-answer), so that more detail can be provided. For observation, my only protocol would be to observe and record everything I can (this includes my third method of finding participants, through social media). Through these methods, I believe that I can find enough valuable information for my research. The way I would analyze my results would be by first coding through all the information. I would look for common themes, opinions, and experiences. Then I would go back through and find any differences. I would then find if there are any discrepancies in what kind of experiences each healthcare worker had, and make conclusions from there. Afterwards, I would find a way to group all of the results and present the data accordingly. For my research, I don’t have a specific hypothesis. The purpose of my research is to highlight the actual, real-life experiences of healthcare workers, and how specific COVID-19 related issues in healthcare have affected the way they can deliver quality healthcare to patients; the purpose of my research is not to find information that supports my thoughts/a particular agenda.</p>
